# PrototypePattern
This was an assignment for Software Engineering in the Spring of 2023

## Here is the Assignment Prompt
Research a different java pattern and create a Java program that implements this pattern. Make a demo for your program that has (at least) 2 options. Option 1 should be to print an "about" for you program. This should include what pattern you are using, what it does, and how it is useful to your program. Option 2 should run some sort of demo of your program. It does not need to be especially complex, but it should do something. It should also use the pattern in a useful way, not just implement it for the sake of implementing it.

I chose the Prototype Pattern :)
